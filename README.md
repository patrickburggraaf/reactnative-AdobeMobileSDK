# React Native app with Adobe Mobile SDK Bridge
React native app with Adobe Mobile SDK bridge

This package contains a complete React Native app with a bridge to the mobile SDK from Adobe. Currently we do not have a native React Native SDK, thus needed to build a custom bridge from IOS to the javascript code. More details on how to build a bridge from scratch; https://hub.packtpub.com/using-native-sdks-and-libraries-react-native/

# How to use
1) Install react-native
2) Run react-native start in the directory
3) Open Xcode project and build and run the code
4) You should see the mobile app

# What is included
Currently three functions are included; trackAction, trackState and setLifecycleMetric. See more in the AdobeMobileReact.m file
